# egui_example

This example uses [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe), a framework for writing apps using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/).

## Getting started

Guide website coming soonâ„¢

### Learning about egui

`src/app.rs` contains a simple example app. This is just to give some inspiration - please make something more cfreative than a todo list application.

The official egui docs are at <https://docs.rs/egui>. If you prefer watching a video introduction, check out <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUkr_z7l84>. For inspiration, check out the [the egui web demo](https://emilk.github.io/egui/index.html) and follow the links in it to its source code.

### Testing locally

`cargo run --release`

On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint etc... you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

On Nixos, you can use the included `flake.nix` by running:

`nix develop`

## Updating egui

As of 2023, egui is in active development with frequent releases with breaking changes.

When updating `egui` and `eframe` it is recommended you do so one version at the time, and read about the changes in [the egui changelog](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [eframe changelog](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/crates/eframe/CHANGELOG.md).
